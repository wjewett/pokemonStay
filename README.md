PokemonStay

A RESTful app to store a Pokemon collection. Uses Pokeapi for most Pokemon information and the included pokedex.json file for evolution information. Supports through Gen VI, but is very simple and only has the default/regular pokemon for any with alternate forms. Includes authentication.

Dev Stack: 
Built on Node v10.16.0 and MongoDB v4.0.10, with Express and numerous other packages (see package.json). 

Special thanks to hellobrian for the pokedex.json file. I've edited some, but it was a huge help.
